The config used in the apache2 example config.txt is what is used on my servers on AWS.

The following Apache modules needed to be enabled:
    proxy
    proxy_http
    proxy_wstunnel

These can be enabled with a2enmod <modulename>

The index.html needs to be dropped into a folder, and the paths changed on the socket.io connection as and where needed.
