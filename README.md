# Resolvr DNS Server
Resolvr DNS server and supporting configuration Updating with PHP script. _note to self be more imaginitive_

# Installation #

With NodeJS and NPM installed, run the following:
``` npm install``` followed by ``` npm start ``` to start it.

# Start-up issues #

If you have an existing resolver enabled and listening on port 53, you will need to disable it. For newer ubuntu users, look up *disable systemd-resolved* and that should guide you through it. 


# Known Bugs #

For a change I will empty my head into the *issues* section of GitHub. You may want check that out.
